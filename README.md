# My creations to contibution!
In this repository you can access the main open source projects that I have developed! I hope you enjoy it.<br />

MIT licensees will guarantee my rights to these contributions, however my constructions can be used by anyone as long as they do not infringe on the rights already reserved.

### Oops, attention!
#### I want to make a few things clear right away:
- I specialize in web automation and process automation / RPA (Robotic process automation);
- I can develop algorithms for simple/complex solutions, graphical interfaces (with tk.inter) and I develop web systems (sites) in Django;
- I work with data through Python, for treatment, problem solving, analysis or for Artificial Intelligence;
- I'm specializing in Machine Learning with Python (I study the mathematical concepts of algorithms, and apply them in Python);
- Some contributions are from when I was starting to study programming, however over time I will import more significant projects so that all interested parties can enjoy them.
<p>I have the aforementioned programming skills and knowledge with Python.<br />
Therefore, the main folder of my contributions is the "Python" folder, and inside it will be all my public projects (for now).<p />
